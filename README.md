Blog of the (p)repair project.

We create (p)repair to help people reduce their consumption of products.

Firstly, we bet on building a mobile application.

Users will reference their products, and they will receive notifications about maintenance gestures over time, for these products. This will rely on a huge open database, that everyone will be able to enhance. We hope it to bring more transparency on products, on the long term.

We are based in France, and we start here. But our aim is borderless!
