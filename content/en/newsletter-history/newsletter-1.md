**Hello from Caen, Normandy!**

If you receive this email today, it’s because you already heard about (p)repair.

We will start by saying you a very huge THANK YOU, because you are part of our first supporters, and **it is really really important to get you by our side!**

For the fist newsletter of our history, we will give you 2 key numbers on **the problem that we want to attack:**

*   50% of failures on products that we use are due to a lack of maintenance [^1], [^2], [^3]
*   it represents 14 millions of household appliances / year in France [^2]

**And so, how will we deal with that?**

→ By allowing you to register the products that you own on our application, to:

*   send you push notification on their good maintenance
*   encourage you
*   discover until where we will go together, because we believe that union makes force

**Where are we now?**

→ We just ended an intensive 3 months program with Normandie Incubation: the Sterne route. [^4]
It closed with a pitch contest on 16/06/2023!

→ We met several actors ready to engage with us to conduct pilot projects. We will quote in this letter:

*   Damien Cottebrune, passionate professional repairer, founder of Livermore, but also columnist for France 3 and Radio France bleu!
    Livermore is a repair shop that unites a community of more than 5 000 customers and enthusiasts in Cherbourg area, Normandy. [^5]
*   Amélie Barbier, Director of AfB Normandy, passionate by her mission.
    AfB refurbishes electronic devices such as computers and smartphones, with a team composed from 70% of persons with disabilities. Good for society, wallet and environment! [^6]

→ We are today in a phase of development for our application, and we hope to give you excellent news very soon!

**Thank you infinitely for you support <3**

**See you in September!**

Guillaume, from the (p)repair team
