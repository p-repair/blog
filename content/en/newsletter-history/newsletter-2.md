**Dear supporters, hello!**

At the time of our last newsletter, sent during the heart of summer, we gave you an appointment in September.

We are… almost here!

**So what did we do since last summer?**

We are working hard on the launch of our MVP, you know, the famous “Minimum Viable Product” in the entrepreneurship jargon, that is the first version of our so awaited application!

**Basically, we are coding.** Since 2 months ½, we spend a lot of time doing so. The good news is that, soon, we'll finally get it, and will be ready to present it to you in exclusivity!

**And it will be a homemade, collaborative tool, ready to put big slaps to breakdowns of your devices!**

In the meantime, here’s a quick overview of the source code we’re working on:

The nerds among you can answer us if they find the programming language used. We would be very happy to hear from you also on our side 😀
 

**Remember: you are our first supporters, and you are so important to us 💙**
 

We are doing our best to write you some good news as soon as possible!

Guillaume, from the (p)repair team
 

P.S. – We strive on the end of this year for our app launch 🚀
