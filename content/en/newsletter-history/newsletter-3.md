**Hello, from the end of winter!**

It's been almost 1 year since we launched (p)repair, a project of mobile application that allows everyone to reference their household appliances to receive maintenance notifications and other good advice to improve their lifespan.

We met you, and we met several partners who are ready to engage with us.

For several months, we've not been kings of communication, but we are working tirelessly on other fronts.

We learn at every step, and we developed many skills since the beginning of this project.

**Today, we are happy to ask for your opinion on our future logo.**

You can send us your preferences and inform us about your choices by participating in this short form:

[**https://framaforms.org/chose-prepair-logo-1710428769**](https://framaforms.org/chose-prepair-logo-1710428769)

**It takes you 2 minutes** (unless the choice seems sooo difficult), and itâ€™s very useful for us!

Here are the 3 logos in the race (at least they will all be on the podium):

**Many thanks for your support of our project ðŸ’™**

Guillaume, from (p)repair team
